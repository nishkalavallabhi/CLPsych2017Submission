My submission to CLPsych Shared task 2017 (http://clpsych.org/shared-task-2017/) 
on triaging content from a online support forum website posts. 

The forjournal folder has a small writeup I prepared summarizing what I did. It is a part of a larger article lead by the shared task organizers
(under prep).
